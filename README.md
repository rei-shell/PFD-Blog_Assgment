# PFD-Blog_Assgment
<b>Problem Statement: <i>Make Digital Banking Accessible for everyone</i></b>

# Week 1:
<b>Main User: <i>Visually Impaired/Blind</b></i>

<b>What we Found</b>
<ul>
  <li>CAPTCHA(Completely Automated Public Turing tests to tell Computers and Humans Apart) can be a problem to those people.</li>
  <li>People will need to take a lot of time to navigate through the pages, dropdowns, menus etc in order to go to the feature that they want to access.</li>
  <li>Chatboxes may be unavailable when they want to seek help.</li>
  <li>They may have difficulty making corrections to information they filled into form when there is an error input.</li>
  <li>lack of proper text alternatives for non-text content (images, videos stuff)</li>
  <li>Security Issue when they need to login in public.</li>
</ul>

<b>What challenges faced</b>
<ul>
  <li>We could not identify the exact user as visually impaired is a broad user. For example colorblindness is also considered as one of the visually impaired user. So we are in doubt of the exact user and what the visually impaired user is able to see in real life.</li>
</ul>

<b>What we planning</b>
<p>To find out the what user could see in real life and find a relative solution for ocbc and create a related solution for their webpage.</p>

<b>Reflection</b>
<p>We are keen about how we could make ocbc webpage accessible for everybody however we will tend to meet things that we could not solve and for now it is to identify what the user could and could not see. I think through the first meeting with my groupmates, we are able to identify most of the problems for the visually impaired user and could think of a few ways to allow the webpage more accessible for them to access it.</p>


# Week 2:
<b>Updates on Week 1</b><br>
On Tuesday, we had an online meeting with the OCBC representative. During our call, we mention about the pain points and solutions we thought of during our call on 20 October. The representative said that our solutions are quite similar to each other and we should consider adding some more solutions for our project.

<b>What we planned</b><br>
During our call on 27 October, we had multiple things sorted out with the team. 

Firstly we planned who is supposed to do front end, back end and the overall planning. For me, I am given the task to create the front end layout for the webpage and implement at least one of the back end features in our solutions. I was hesitant for the designing as my designing was not very good, hence I asked them for help with the designing and does the designing part together. 

Secondly, we faced the problem with the Technical part of the project as we do not know if we should use ASP.NET or HTML,CSS,JS. After much discussion with the team, we decided to use ASP.NET as there are many libraries available for the project at ASP.NET.

Finally, we do not know what features we should in the NOT list as for our IN and OUT list we had features added in but we a hard time on deciding if we should add more features to the OUT list. For out NOT list, we had conflict on some of the features, such as the adding more language for the webpage and adding popup messages that could directly talk when shown. For some features, we discuss if those features are mandatory. At the end, we decided that we should at least complete the IN list features first and think if we should implement the OUT and NOT list features.

<b>Reflection</b>
During all the meeting I had been to in this week, I gain more insight on how PFD and SDD in connected in a way that it the knowledge I gained in SDD could make us keep on the right track. Knowing our differences during our call on 27 October, we could help each other out if we could not fix a bug and we could make arrangement on the work load so that my groupmates does not have to work with the skills that they are weak in.

# Week 3
<b>Updates on week 2</b><br>
I have started creating the login page for our project. During the face-to-face lesson on 31 October, we experiment on what the visually impaired user could see on the phhysical website of OCBC by removing our glasses and view the website from a distance. We realise that the color white as the background is not suitable as the mouse will not be seen. We also found out that the wordings for the website is too small. However, when we changed the theme of the laptop to a high contrast theme, the background color of the webpage changes and the colors when hovering over the drop down navbar changes to a brighter color. We also found out that the webpage does not require the user to type their information as much, most of the information they need to enter are in radio button or dropdown option.</b>
