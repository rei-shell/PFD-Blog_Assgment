<b>Problem Statement: <i>Make Digital Banking Accessible for everyone</i></b>

# Week 1:
<b>Main User: <i>Visually Impaired/Blind</b></i>

<b>What we Found</b>
<ul>
  <li>CAPTCHA(Completely Automated Public Turing tests to tell Computers and Humans Apart) can be a problem to those people.</li>
  <li>People will need to take a lot of time to navigate through the pages, dropdowns, menus etc in order to go to the feature that they want to access.</li>
  <li>Chatboxes may be unavailable when they want to seek help.</li>
  <li>They may have difficulty making corrections to information they filled into form when there is an error input.</li>
  <li>lack of proper text alternatives for non-text content (images, videos stuff)</li>
  <li>Security Issue when they need to login in public.</li>
</ul>

<b>What challenges faced</b>
<ul>
  <li>We could not identify the exact user as visually impaired is a broad user. For example colorblindness is also considered as one of the visually impaired user. So we are in doubt of the exact user and what the visually impaired user is able to see in real life.</li>
</ul>

<b>What we planning</b>
<p>To find out the what user could see in real life and find a relative solution for ocbc and create a related solution for their webpage.</p>

<b>Reflection</b>
<p>We are keen about how we could make ocbc webpage accessible for everybody however we will tend to meet things that we could not solve and for now it is to identify what the user could and could not see. I think through the first meeting with my groupmates, we are able to identify most of the problems for the visually impaired user and could think of a few ways to allow the webpage more accessible for them to access it.</p>
