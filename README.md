<b>Problem Statement: <i>Make Digital Banking Accessible for everyone</i></b>

<ul>Our team: </ul>
<li>Jia Yi</li>
<li>Rachelle</li>
<li>Klayton</li>
<li>Kester</li>
<li>Natalie</li>

# Week 1:
<b>Main User: <i>Visually Impaired/Blind</b></i>

<b>What we Found</b>
<ul>
  <li>CAPTCHA(Completely Automated Public Turing tests to tell Computers and Humans Apart) can be a problem to those people.</li>
  <li>People will need to take a lot of time to navigate through the pages, dropdowns, menus etc in order to go to the feature that they want to access.</li>
  <li>Chatboxes may be unavailable when they want to seek help.</li>
  <li>They may have difficulty making corrections to information they filled into form when there is an error input.</li>
  <li>lack of proper text alternatives for non-text content (images, videos stuff)</li>
  <li>Security Issue when they need to login in public.</li>
</ul>

<b>What challenges faced</b>
<ul>
  <li>We could not identify the exact user as visually impaired is a broad user. For example colorblindness is also considered as one of the visually impaired user. So we are in doubt of the exact user and what the visually impaired user is able to see in real life.</li>
</ul>

<b>What we planning</b>
<p>To find out the what user could see in real life and find a relative solution for ocbc and create a related solution for their webpage.</p>

<b>Reflection</b>
<p>We are keen about how we could make ocbc webpage accessible for everybody however we will tend to meet things that we could not solve and for now it is to identify what the user could and could not see. I think through the first meeting with my groupmates, we are able to identify most of the problems for the visually impaired user and could think of a few ways to allow the webpage more accessible for them to access it.</p>


# Week 2:
<b>Updates on Week 1</b><br>
On Tuesday, we had an online meeting with the OCBC representative. During our call, we mention about the pain points and solutions we thought of during our call on 20 October. The representative said that our solutions are quite similar to each other and we should consider adding some more solutions for our project.

<b>What we planned</b><br>
During our call on 27 October, we had multiple things sorted out with the team. 

Firstly we planned who is supposed to do front end, back end and the overall planning. For me, I am given the task to create the front end layout for the webpage and implement at least one of the back end features in our solutions. I was hesitant for the designing as my designing was not very good, hence I asked them for help with the designing and does the designing part together. 

Secondly, we faced the problem with the Technical part of the project as we do not know if we should use ASP.NET or HTML,CSS,JS. After much discussion with the team, we decided to use ASP.NET as there are many libraries available for the project at ASP.NET.

Finally, we do not know what features we should in the NOT list as for our IN and OUT list we had features added in but we a hard time on deciding if we should add more features to the OUT list. For out NOT list, we had conflict on some of the features, such as the adding more language for the webpage and adding popup messages that could directly talk when shown. For some features, we discuss if those features are mandatory. At the end, we decided that we should at least complete the IN list features first and think if we should implement the OUT and NOT list features.

<b>Reflection</b>
During all the meeting I had been to in this week, I gain more insight on how PFD and SDD in connected in a way that it the knowledge I gained in SDD could make us keep on the right track. Knowing our differences during our call on 27 October, we could help each other out if we could not fix a bug and we could make arrangement on the work load so that my groupmates does not have to work with the skills that they are weak in.

# Week 3
<b>Updates on week 2</b><br>
I have started creating the login page for our project. During the face-to-face lesson on 31 October, we experiment on what the visually impaired user could see on the phhysical website of OCBC by removing our glasses and view the website from a distance. We realise that the color white as the background is not suitable as the mouse will not be seen. We also found out that the wordings for the website is too small. However, when we changed the theme of the laptop to a high contrast theme, the background color of the webpage changes and the colors when hovering over the drop down navbar changes to a brighter color. We also found out that the webpage does not require the user to type their information as much, most of the information they need to enter are in radio button or dropdown option.</b>

<b>What we discussed</b><br>
During our call on 5 November, we planned on how the webpage should looks like and as their front end developer, I had to start coding the webpage in order for the back end developer, Kester and Jia Yi to start working on the speech-to-text features. 

<b>Reflection</b><br>
After the meeting on 31 October, I started coding the homepage of the webpage and continued the webpage design based on hte wireframe planned together with Jia Yi. 

# Week 4
<b>Updates on week 3</b><br>
During our update call with ocbc on 31 October, we showned them our wireframe for our webpage and our implemented features, speech-to-text. During the call, I was working on the setting page for card activation for the user after they login to the webpage and had received their credit card. After the pfd class, our member who is working database, Klayton, completed with the data input and allowed user to login. 

<b>What we discussed</b><br>
We were discussing on whether we should include a toggle button where if the user needs the speech-to-text function, the user would toggle it and will activate the speech-to-text function. However if the user does not need the function, the user does not need to toggle the button to activate the function. We also discussed on where we should place the toggle button, if we should place the button in the homgpage or after the user had logged in.

<b>Reflection</b><br>
I planned on at least finishing the homepage ui design for the homepage and at least finish half of the ui setting pages. After the call with the ocbc team, I felt more motivated to complete my UI design for the webpage even if there are stuff that I could not figure out. I am quite grateful for having group mates that is willing to help each other when one's is in doubt and is able to solve the problem together and speak out their doubt and confirm with the team.

# Week 5
<b>Updates on week 4</b><br>
After confirming what our roles are in week 4, we focused on what we had to complete and set a dateline on each features completion date. 

<b>Reflection</b><br>
During week 5, we had a 3 days hackathon and on the last day of the hackathon we went to ocbc campus for our prenstation pitch to ocbc. Even though our website ui was quite ugly, we managed to make most of our features work and in condition. However there were parts we did not present as there were time limitations. From the feedback gain from the ocbc representative, we might implement a feature to allow user to record their voice into the system and use it everytime they logged in. I might be adding some other features to the webpage such as alternative verfication methods. I will also be changing most of the UI design of the webpage as the current UI was just a basic design, I would be changing the hompage design and most of the font of the webpage.

# Week 12
<b>Updates</b><br>
I managed to improve on some of the UI of the webpage and implement some new features to the transfer page together with Jia Yi.

<b>Reflection</b><br>
After our short break from the hackathon, we tried to sort our features out and plan on what features should we improve on and which features is considered as done. After planning with our features, we decide on which pages UI we should improve and implement other new features to our webpage.

# Week 13
<b>Updates</b><br>
We managed to identify some features to update on our code. We will be deciding on how to split the work evenly to one another.

<b>Reflection</b><br>
After our short descussion, we decided to work on serveral features and each members to choose one of the features that they are more confident to complete.

# Week 14
<b>Updates</b><br>
We updated our plans to our teacher and continued our UI improvement and updates of our website.

<b>Reflection</b><br>
After spliting the work, we continued to work on the features.

# Week 15
<b>Updates</b><br>
After updating our teacher about our features, we asked for feedback and request about some features that may be improved.

<b>Reflection</b><br>
It was a interesting experience.

# Week 16
<b>Updates</b><br>
Because of the lack of time and rushing of other modules assigment, we actually had limited time to work on our pfd updates and we were a little behind time. We tried to make use of our time in making this assigment better than the first product that we presented in OCBC last month.

<b>Reflection</b><br>
Before the week ended, we tried to improve on making some of the flaws or bugs disappear. After making prefecting the flaws, we tried the think of some extra features that might work for our user which is visually impaired.

# Week 17
<b>Reflection</b><br>
Before our presentation, there is some flaws on our speech to text features. During our rehearsal, I could allow the feature work prefectly. However, during the presentation, my sore throat went bad and the features suddenly did not work for most of the parts. After the presentation, I felt very bad as I could not present as what I expected and thought if I had healed my throat before the presentation, my part would be working as expected.
